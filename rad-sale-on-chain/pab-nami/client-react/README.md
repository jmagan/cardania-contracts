# Getting Started 

Before building the package we need to clone the nami-wallet git repository:

`$ git clone --depth 1 --branch 2.3.6 https://github.com/Berry-Pool/nami-wallet.git lib/nami-wallet`

The next step is to install all dependencies:

`$ yarn`

When all the dependencies are installed, then execute the PAB server for the pab-nami demo. Finally, we can serve our React app:

`yarn start`

When you compile it for the first time, we need to reload the webpage if it's blank.
